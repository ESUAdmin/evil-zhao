# Evil Zhao

ESU wiki founding committe (2019-) https://typcn.org

## Victims

### [typcn](https://github.com/typcn) - Tengyu Niu

A skilled computer hacker who disclosed the Privacy Gate of Alipay and went on Chinese TV for it. Arrested in the end of Aug, 2019.

He was the server operator and DMCA agent of ESU wiki (lit. 'Vulgar Wiki') and had nothing to do with political affairs (doxxing Xi Jinping & Xi Mingze). However, the Maoming police & court set him up as the 'main culprit' of ESU activities (the doxxing), accused him of false claims such as illegal business, provocation, invading personal information and sentenced him 14 years in prison.

He was brutally tortured during the investigation. The police officers beat him so hard that he was sent to ICU. Information can be seen in [Niu's letter of grievance](至各位用户、客户的信以及个人情况声明.md).

Published by his lawyer on V2EX the programmers' forum (actually the webmaster Liu Xin's personal site). Deleted due to site owner's fear of police arrest.

The followings are in Japanese, some statements are not true, ~e.g. they died in police facilities,~ which was due to the secrecy of the case. Police had removed their identities from computer systems.
